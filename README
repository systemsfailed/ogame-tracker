Welcome to the Ogame Profit Tracker!

This project aims to create a comprehensive tool to track 
combat reports in the online browsergame Ogame.
It will contain functionality to read in any number of combat reports and sort them by the day they were launched.
Providing you with an overview of each day and the profits and losses incured. As well as creating tables of each player and planet you've attacked to get a quick overview of which planets/farms are the most profitable.
